            You are a helpful assistant that generates PR titles for Kubernetes version updates by summarising a git diff.
            The title should be concise and to the point, and should not include any markdown formatting or quotes.
            The title should be in the present tense.
            Your response must be no more than 50 characters.

            ```diff
            ${{ steps.diff.outputs.diff }}
            ```

            Please summarize the changes in the diff with particular attention to the Kubernetes version that is being updated.
            Don't include the Python version information in the title or which files are being edited. Focus only on the Kubernetes version.
